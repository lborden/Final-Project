# CEE 609 Final Project
This repository contains information regarding a canopy cover vegetation study for CEE 609: Environmental Data Science. All work has been completed by Luke Borden.
# Introduction
Canopy cover of different forms of vegetation is critical for landscape architects when choosing different planting features. Not only is canopy cover considered for aesthetic purposes, but also for providing animal habitats, regulating temperature, and soil health.
# Research Question
Can data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency be used to assist landscape architects in selecting proper vegetation species for environmental ecosystems based on the canopy cover percentage?

This study will focus specifically on analyzing the differences between different vegetation types and how well different predictors are of use in determining canopy cover. The coefficient of determination is used to represent the variance between the dependent variable of canopy cover and the variables used in the regression model.
